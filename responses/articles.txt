Whether you're battling fearsome mobs, mining deep within the earth, or exploring new realms, mastering enchantments is the key to taking your Minecraft experience to the next level.</p><h2 id=\"diversity-of-enchantments\">Diversity of Enchantments</h2><p>Minecraft Enchantments come in a vast array of types, each bestowing unique advantages and augmenting your abilities in different ways. Here are some examples of enchantments and how they can transform your gameplay:</p><h3 id=\"1-sharpness-sword-enchantment\"><em>1 Sharpness (Sword Enchantment)</em></h3><p>The Sharpness enchantment increases the damage dealt by your sword, allowing you to vanquish your enemies swiftly. With higher levels of Sharpness, you can slice through hostile mobs with ease and take on formidable adversaries more effectively.</p><h3 id=\"2-fortune-tool-enchantment\"><em>2. Fortune (Tool Enchantment)</em></h3><p>Fortune is a game-changing enchantment for your mining adventures. When applied to a pickaxe, shovel, or axe, Fortune increases the chances of obtaining extra resources from blocks. For example, mining coal ore with a Fortune-enchanted pickaxe can yield a greater number of coal items, maximizing your resource gathering efforts.</p><h3 id=\"3-feather-falling-boots-enchantment\"><em>3. Feather Falling (Boots Enchantment)</em></h3><p>Falling from great heights can be perilous, but with the Feather Falling enchantment, you can mitigate fall damage and land gracefully. This enchantment is especially valuable when traversing treacherous terrain, exploring high cliffs, or engaging in epic battles that involve elevation changes.</p><h3 id=\"4-unbreaking-armortool-enchantment\"><em>4. Unbreaking (Armor/Tool Enchantment)</em></h3><p>The Unbreaking enchantment significantly extends the durability of your armor and tools, ensuring they last longer before requiring repairs. With Unbreaking, you can confidently embark on long expeditions without fear of your equipment wearing out too quickly.</p><h3 id=\"5-flame-bow-enchantment\"><em>5. Flame (Bow Enchantment)</em></h3><p>Ignite your arrows with the Flame enchantment, turning your bow into a fiery weapon. When you shoot an arrow with Flame, it sets your enemies ablaze, dealing additional fire damage. This enchantment is especially effective against mobs vulnerable to fire, adding an extra element of strategy to your battles.</p><h2 id=\"applying-enchantments\">Applying Enchantments</h2><h3 id=\"1-enchanting-table\"><em>1. Enchanting Table</em></h3><ul><li>The primary method of enchanting in Minecraft is through an Enchanting Table. To use it, you'll need experience levels and Lapis Lazuli as a fuel source.</li><li>Place the Enchanting Table down in a well-lit area and interact with it.</li><li>You'll see three enchantment options on the right side of the interface, along with a book symbol and enchantment levels.</li><li>Place the item you want to enchant in the slot on the left side of the interface. This can be a weapon, tool, or a piece of armor.</li><li>Once you have the required experience levels and Lapis Lazuli, select an enchantment by clicking on it. The enchantment levels will determine the strength of the enchantment.</li><li>Finally, click on the enchant button to enchant the item. The Enchanting Table will consume your experience levels and Lapis Lazuli, and your item will be enchanted with the chosen enchantment.</li></ul><h3 id=\"2-anvil\"><em>2. Anvil</em></h3><ul><li>Minecraft Enchantments can also be applied using an Anvil. The Anvil allows you to combine enchanted books or repair enchanted items.</li><li>Place the Anvil down and interact with it.</li><li>In your inventory, have the item you want to enchant and the desired enchanted books ready.</li><li>Place the item in the left slot of the Anvil interface and the enchanted book in the right slot.</li><li>The Anvil will display the resulting item in the output slot, along with an experience cost.</li><li>If you're satisfied with the combination, take the newly enchanted item from the output slot.</li></ul><h3 id=\"3-enchanted-books\"><em>3. Enchanted Books</em></h3><ul><li>Enchanted books can be found in dungeons, mineshafts, strongholds, and can also be obtained by trading with villagers or fishing.</li><li>To use an enchanted book, simply place it in your inventory and right-click it. The enchantment from the book will be applied to the next item you enchant on an Enchanting Table or use on an Anvil.</li></ul><p><br><br></p>",

To craft a furnace, place eight blocks of cobblestone in the crafting interface, leaving the center block empty.</p><p><strong>Iron Pickaxe</strong>: The iron pickaxe is a more durable and efficient tool than the wooden pickaxe.

In this guide, we will explore everything you need to know about Minecraft Villages, including trading, raiding, and more.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-minecraft-villages\">What are Minecraft Villages?</h2><p>Minecraft Villages are groups of NPCs that live together in a specific location. These NPCs are called Villagers and they can be found in different biomes throughout the game. Villages consist of various structures, including houses, farms, and wells. They offer a variety of resources, such as food, weapons, and tools.</p><h2 id=\"trading-with-villagers\">Trading with Villagers</h2><p>One of the most interesting features of Minecraft Villages is the ability to trade with Villagers. Each Villager has a specific profession and will offer different trades based on that profession. For example, a Farmer Villager may offer trades for crops, while a Blacksmith Villager may offer trades for weapons and armor. To trade with a Villager, you will need to have emeralds, which are obtained by mining or trading with other Villagers.</p><h2 id=\"protecting-villages-from-raids\">Protecting Villages from Raids</h2><p>Villages are vulnerable to raids from hostile mobs, such as zombies and pillagers. To protect a Village from a raid, you can build walls, light up the area with torches, and place defensive structures like iron golems. Iron golems are large, powerful mobs that will defend Villagers from hostile mobs. They can be created by placing four iron blocks in a T-shape and then adding a pumpkin on top.</p><h2 id=\"expanding-and-customising-villages\">Expanding and Customising Villages</h2><p>You can also expand and customize Villages by adding new structures, such as farms, houses, and walls. This can be done by using the same materials as the original structures or by using new materials to create unique designs. You can also change the look of Villagers by using different skins and textures.</p>",

      "html": "<p>In this blog post, we'll cover the basics of creating a Skript command.</p><h1 id=\"first-off-the-syntax\">First off, <u>the Syntax</u>.</h1><p>Custom commands are the most essential part of Skript. They allow your players to run command that you create that makes your server even more unique. </p><p>Just like anything else in Skript, in order to create a command you must follow a general syntax: <code>command /&lt;<strong>command_name</strong>&gt; &lt;<strong>arguments</strong>&gt;:</code>. This is the syntax you'll have to use when creating a custom command.</p><p>Following this, we can add some <strong>command options</strong>, such as permission or description. You don't need to include any of these, but they just allow you to further modify your command.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-toggle-card\" data-kg-toggle-state=\"close\"><div class=\"kg-toggle-heading\"><h4 class=\"kg-toggle-heading-text\">Full <strong>list of command options (click) &gt;</strong></h4><button class=\"kg-toggle-card-icon\"><svg id=\"Regular\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path class=\"cls-1\" d=\"M23.25,7.311,12.53,18.03a.749.749,0,0,1-1.06,0L.75,7.311\"/></svg></button></div><div class=\"kg-toggle-content\"><p><strong>aliases: </strong>A list of aliases for your command (seperated by a comma).<br><strong>executable by: </strong>Specifies who can use the command (console, players).<br><strong>usage: </strong>A message sent to the user if they used the command incorrectly.<br><strong>description: </strong>A description for the command.<br><strong>permission: </strong>A permission required to run the command.<br><strong>permission message: </strong>A message sent to the user if they don't have the permission required.<br><strong>cooldown:</strong> A cooldown for the command.<br><strong>cooldown message: </strong>A message sent to the user if the cooldown has not expired.<br><strong>cooldown bypass: </strong>A permission required to bypass the cooldown of a command.<br><strong>cooldown storage:</strong> A variable that the cooldown is stored in, it will stay even after the server restarts.</p></div></div><p>After we've included our command options, we <strong>must</strong> add a <code>trigger:</code> below. The trigger tells Skript that we've finished with our options, and to run the code we type from this point on. Now, we indent and add our custom code. Your code should now look as follows:</p><pre><code>command /&lt;command_name&gt; &lt;argument&gt;:\n    permission: permission.use\n    trigger:\n    \t# code here</code></pre><h2 id=\"arguments\">Arguments</h2><p>Arguments are just <strong>user inputs</strong>. You can add arguments to a command by specifying what type must be entered by adding it to the command using angled brackets such as <code>&lt;integer&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;string&gt;</code>. You can add multiple arguments of different types, such as <code>command /ban &lt;player&gt; &lt;timespan&gt;:</code>. </p><p>In your code, you'll need to <strong>access</strong> these arguments. In order to do this, you can use <code>arg-(<strong>argument number</strong> starting at 1)</code>. For example to access the 'player' input in the above command, we would use <code>arg-1</code>, and to access the timespan, we'd use <code>arg-2</code>. There are alternatives to getting arguments, however I recommend using what we've just covered.</p><p>Currently, our arguments are <strong>mandatory</strong> and must be entered, however, we can make arguments <strong>optional</strong> by surrounding it in square brackets: <code>[&lt;player&gt;]</code> or <code>[&lt;string&gt;]</code>.</p><p>You can also add a <strong>default value</strong> for your arguments, meaning if a player does not enter anything for that argument, it will be set to a default value. You can do this by adding <code>= default value</code> in the argument section. For example <code>command /command_name &lt;string = \"Hello World!\"&gt;:</code>.</p><h2 id=\"your-turntest-yourself\">Your Turn! - Test Yourself.</h2><p>Note: the answer is directly below the instructions. No cheating!</p><ul><li>Make a command named <strong>calculate</strong> that takes <strong>two separate integer arguments</strong>, can only be ran by players with the permission <code><strong>calc.use</strong></code>, has a cooldown of <strong>10 seconds</strong>, and then <strong>broadcasts</strong> the two numbers added.</li></ul><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.minefort.com/content/images/2022/11/carbon-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"940\" height=\"552\" srcset=\"https://blog.minefort.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/carbon-1.png 600w, https://blog.minefort.com/content/images/2022/11/carbon-1.png 940w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure>",

      "html": "<p>When running a Minecraft server, choosing what plugins you have and how they are set up is essential to the success of the server. Choose bad plugins that lag the server or that you don’t know how to use and the server will be a disaster. Choose good plugins, however, and it’s much more likely to be successful. This is a guide to help you choose the good plugins for your server. Here are the top 10 plugins you absolutely need to have on your Minecraft server. <br></p><p><strong>10. VotingPlugin</strong><br></p><p>VotingPlugin is an advanced vote listener. It allows you to give rewards for players voting on sites and hooks into VotifierPlus. It even has sound effects! Voting is extremely important for any public server, and this plugin helps you incentivize players to vote.<br></p><p><strong>9. Holographic Displays</strong><br></p><p>Holographic Displays uses invisible armor stands and name tags to create floating text that all players can read. If you’ve ever seen something like this on a server like Hypixel, it was probably this plugin. This plugin is a must-have for any public server.<br></p><p><strong>8. NoCheatPlus</strong><br></p><p>NoCheatPlus prevents cheat clients from exploiting weaknesses in Minecraft or its protocol, making your server safe. It covers a large range of cheats including flying, speeding, duplicating, inventory hacks, and more. <br></p><p><strong>7. ClearLagg</strong><br></p><p>ClearLagg is the best lag/exploit prevention plugin out there. It’s entirely customizable and definitely a must-have for any Minecraft server.<br></p><p><strong>6. CoreProtect</strong><br></p><p>CoreProtect is a data logging and anti-griefing tool. It allows you to roll back your server in case of massive griefing, corruption, or any other reason, and it doesn’t even affect your server's performance!<br></p><p><strong>5. VotifierPlus</strong><br></p><p>VotifierPlus connects your server to voting websites, allowing players on your server to vote, moving your server up, and gaining you more publicity. It also allows other plugins to hook into it to allow you to give your players rewards for voting!<br></p><p><strong>4. WorldEdit/WorldGuard</strong><br></p><p>WorldEdit is a plugin that allows you to build massive structures in half the time. It uses setblock commands to allow you to place large amounts of blocks, paint things, and randomize them. Anything you can dream of building in Minecraft can be made easier with WorldEdit. WorldGuard uses WorldEdit to create regions that players can be given access to or not. It will prevent unwanted players from entering or breaking anything in a region. Absolutely needed for any public server.<br></p><p><strong>3. Vault</strong><br></p><p>Vault is a permission, chat, and economy API that gives plugins easy hooks into these systems without having to hook or depend on each individual plugin themselves. In other words, it allows things like LuckPerms, EssentialsX, VotingPlugin, and many other plugins to connect to each other. <br></p><p><strong>2. LuckPerms</strong><br></p><p>LuckPerms is the ultimate rank plugin. It allows you to create ranks with different permissions, looks, and colors and is extremely customizable. It even has a web dashboard, allowing you to configure everything about the plugin on a website.<br></p><p><strong>1. EssentialsX</strong><br></p><p>EssentialsX is, well, essential. This plugin allows you to do a multitude of things, including moderation, command shortcuts, and even economy. Many other plugins use EssentialsX as a backbone as well.</p>",

      "title": "Skript - Introduction to Functions",
      "slug": "skript-functions",
      "html": "<p>In this blog post, we'll cover the basics of functions within Skript.</p><h2 id=\"first-off-what-are-functions\">First off, <u>what are Functions</u>?</h2><p>Functions allow you to create <strong>reusable sections of code</strong>. Functions should be used for code that is repeated, rather than copying and pasting the code. Not only does it make the script smaller and improves performance, it makes it much easier for yourself and others to read.</p><hr><h2 id=\"creating-a-function\">Creating a Function</h2><p>In order to create a function, simply use <code>function myFunctionName():</code>. Then, after the colon, we go on to the next line, indent, and write the code that we want to run when the function is called. In this blog, we'll create a simple function that broadcasts a welcome message.</p><p>Firstly, we'll create a function called welcome: <code>function welcome():</code>. On the next line, we'll <strong>indent</strong> and add the <strong>broadcast effect</strong> with the message \"Welcome to the server\". The code should look like this:</p><pre><code>function welcome():\n\tbroadcast \"Welcome to the server!\"</code></pre><hr><h2 id=\"calling-a-function\">Calling a Function</h2><p>In order to call a function, we simply <strong>type it's name</strong> in the code, followed by its brackets. For example if your function was called 'welcome', you'd use <code>welcome()</code> in your code. </p><p>Furthermore, if the function accepts <strong>parameters</strong> (discussed below), you can also pass the parameters in, just make sure they are of the same type as specified when the function was created. Such as: <code>welcome(player)</code> or <code>kill(arg-1)</code>.</p><p>If the function <strong>returns</strong> something (discussed below), you can use it as an expression, such as <code>set {variable} to function()</code>, or <code>broadcast function()</code>.</p><hr><h2 id=\"parameters-in-functions\">Parameters in Functions</h2><p>As there are no parameters in the code we've just created, we can't actually specify a player to welcome. Within the brackets, we can add <strong>parameters</strong> into the function. The syntax is: <code>function welcome(p: player):</code>. Here, we have created a local variable (the variable can only be used within the function), and set it to type <strong>player</strong>, meaning that only a player can be passed in.</p><p>Now when we add code to our function we can use the <strong>local variable</strong> we created to reference whatever we pass into the function when called. In order to use the local variable, we use <code>{_p}</code> (local variables are prefixed automatically with an <strong>underscore</strong>). This means in our broadcast, we can specify the player we want to welcome: <code>broadcast \"Welcome %{_p}% to the server!\"</code>.</p><hr><h2 id=\"returning-data-from-a-function\">Returning data from a Function</h2><p>Functions are also able to <strong>return data</strong>. In order to do this, we must declare what the function will return as we create it, and add it to the code. For example if our function will return a string, we will code: <code>function welcome() :: <strong>string</strong>:</code>, or if our function will return an integer, we would code: <code>function welcome() :: <strong>integer</strong>:</code>. Note that you can return any valid type that Skript has, much more than just string and integer. Now in our code, we must use the <strong>return</strong> effect, which simply returns whatever you input. In our welcome example, it would be as follows:</p><pre><code>function welcome() :: string:\n\treturn \"Welcome to the server!\"\n    \non join:\n\tsend welcome()</code></pre><p>You should note that when you use the return effect, the function will <strong>stop</strong> <strong>running</strong> and will exit.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue\"><div class=\"kg-callout-text\"><strong>Something wrong with this article? </strong>Reach out to me, @Adxm#9504, and we'll get it fixed!</div></div><h2 id=\"your-turn-test-yourself\">Your Turn! Test Yourself.</h2><p>Note: the answer is directly below the instructions. No cheating!</p><ul><li>Create a function named <strong>calculate</strong> that takes in <strong>two integers</strong> and <strong>returns</strong> the two numbers <strong>added</strong>.</li></ul><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.minefort.com/content/images/2022/11/carbon-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1312\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"https://blog.minefort.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/carbon-5.png 600w, https://blog.minefort.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/carbon-5.png 1000w, https://blog.minefort.com/content/images/2022/11/carbon-5.png 1312w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure>",

Functions should be used for code that is repeated, rather than copying and pasting the code. Not only does it make the script smaller and improves performance, it makes it much easier for yourself and others to read.\n\n\nCreating a Function\n\nIn order to create a function, simply use function myFunctionName():.

      "slug": "6-minecraft-combat-tips-and-tricks-to-dominate-in-battle",
      "html": "<p>Let’s face it: the most exciting part of Minecraft is undoubtedly the combat. Whether you’re exploring, building, crafting or farming; everything leads to a final showdown with a horde of monsters, humans or animals. If you ask any seasoned Minecraft player, they will probably tell you that the most challenging—and rewarding—part about playing Minecraft is mastering the art of combat. There are different types of creatures in Minecraft and each one poses a unique challenge to players. However, there are some tricks and tips that can make your journey a little easier. Knowing how to fight effectively and efficiently can be the difference between life and death in Minecraft. That said, here are 5 useful tips and tricks on how to dominate in battle<br></p><h2 id=\"know-your-enemies\">Know your enemies</h2><p>Any time you enter an encounter, the first thing you’ll need to know is your enemy. This is especially important if you’re facing a new type of enemy. Knowing your enemy will help you in two ways - First, it will let you know what type of armour you should wear. Second, it will let you know which weapons you should use. For example, if you know that skeletons are immune to arrows, then you’ll want to use a different type of weapon. Knowing your enemies will also help you plan your strategy against them. Knowing that zombies have a long range attack, you’ll want to stay out of their reach and use a weapon that’s effective at a distance. The more you explore, the more you’ll learn about the various enemies in Minecraft. This will make fighting them much easier.<br></p><h2 id=\"build-build-build\">Build, build, build</h2><p>Building a good defensive structure is the best way to protect yourself against attacks. When you’re building your fortress, you want to make sure that you’re building it in a way that makes it easy to defend. For example, you can build a wall that slopes outwards. This will make it easier to fend off mobs. Building a roof will also help you against certain types of enemies. This is especially true against Creepers. When building a roof, make sure that it slopes downwards. This will help towards repelling the explosion of Creepers. Building a shelter near a village can be an excellent way to defend yourself against Creepers. Whenever you build, keep in mind that you’re not just building for aesthetics; you’re building for defence.<br></p><h2 id=\"stay-on-the-move\">Stay on the move</h2><p>When you’re fighting, it’s always a good idea to stay as mobile as possible. This is especially true if you’re fighting a large mob. Large mobs will have a harder time hitting you if you’re constantly moving around. This will make it easier for you to avoid their attacks. If you’re fighting a smaller mob, then you might want to consider staying still. This will allow you to focus on attacking the enemy. Large mobs, however, will make it harder to hit them. This is especially true if you’re using a ranged weapon. The best way to fight a large mob while staying mobile is to use either a sword or a bow. This way, you’ll be able to keep yourself safe and still be able to attack the mob effectively.<br></p><h2 id=\"keep-your-tools-handy\">Keep your tools handy</h2><p>In any battle, you’ll inevitably lose some weapons. If your weapons break, you’ll want to have a contingency plan in place. You should always have some extra weapons and tools in your inventory. For example, iron swords are excellent for fighting skeletons. However, iron swords will break if you use them in battle against a creeper. Having an extra sword in your inventory can save you a lot of trouble. You should also keep some extra armour pieces in your inventory. This way, you’ll be able to repair your armour pieces easily. Having repair materials like cobwebs and string in your inventory can also be helpful.<br></p><h2 id=\"don%E2%80%99t-forget-to-repair\">Don’t forget to repair!</h2><p>It’s important to keep in mind that your tools and weapons will break eventually. You can maintain and repair your weapons and tools by using an anvil. Using an anvil will let you repair your tools and weapons. You should keep in mind that the higher the level of your tools, the more expensive they’ll be to repair. This means that it’s best to use high-level tools as much as possible. This will save you a lot of money in the long run. It’s also important to repair your armour pieces before they break. If your armour piece breaks during a battle, the damage will be done even before the numbers appear on your screen.<br></p><h2 id=\"bottom-line\">Bottom line</h2><p>The great thing about Minecraft is that you can approach combat almost any way you like. There are tons of different weapon combinations, strategies, and building styles that you can use to defend yourself from enemies. Just remember that the better you are at combat, the more fun you’ll have playing this game. Combat is challenging and may seem difficult at first—but once you learn the basics, it’ll become second nature.</p>",

      "html": "<p>So, you joined or created a survival server. All your friends are on there. But you want to get ahead of them—you want to get diamonds before they even have the chance to make themselves armor. Today, we’ll discuss how you can do that, and the answer to most of your resource problems is automatic farms. Here, we’ll show you what farms to build, how to build them, and provide a few tips and tricks to make your automatic farming easier. <br></p><p>You may be asking, what are automatic farms? And what can they do for me? Well, at their base, automatic farms create or farm items for you without you, as the player, having to do anything other than build them. You can get infinite fuel, create infinite food, etc. <br></p><p>Now, here are the top 3 farms you should build early game:</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-header-card kg-width-full kg-size-small kg-style-dark\" style data-kg-background-image><h2 class=\"kg-header-card-header\" id=\"3-xp-farm\">3. XP Farm</h2></div><p>Experience in Minecraft is important; it allows you to enchant items, repair items, and gets you those sweet, sweet bragging rights. Usually, it takes a while to build up. However, you can make this simple with an XP farm. The first thing you need to do is find a dungeon or a spawner in a mineshaft (skeleton spawners are the best). Next, you want to dig out an area underneath the spawner, big enough to allow mobs to spawn. Make sure to keep the area lit while doing so, you don’t want mobs to spawn while you are working! <br></p><p>Your spawner should look like this:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/4C8C1sKEMC8zNTIFTvn67mcdYNchZt0NjuquFdBfq32bi1NaA9aGhZ1J8fJkT3JHAFr--HhC5oTs0Q1PLC7Jg_lH1qpsgzUMnVD-5NDGG6YI4Ws2UYhi1KXutUSL_rgtnLRVZFyqoMOXbrPILygCkw72mHZ2Oqn5pr4S3oPa4zVq5NUQzt09eBzo11_2bA\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\"></figure><p>The next step is to place flowing water—to move the mobs toward your ‘Killzone.’ Place 3 buckets of water on one side of the chamber, equal distances apart.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SZ6KombxRyWr04jL9xENcVn4Kz34e7EgO2Es3JMc7RI1b2OJM67EMakEXeCW6dEu1vGWds3K03IQDZt4QRRUYr5sYnlpX_o1rCExJPmPD8zj_McoqKhwCIZUOVp5wxbWIqWERUD_43Fx0PgPpzuWOxGzQHjt1vQt2u3ta00g12XEJSuUXF__g1_1fvx5qg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\"></figure><p>After that, dig a trench on the opposite side from where you placed the water. Make sure the mobs can fit into it! Have the trench drop down about 2 blocks, and place gates to make sure no water slips down.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/q644vauhFWIGwlJQcJEVUFHX6alhe2jduhAxi31XLMurhraLzWVbOnnmXhWbPe_jshoVEXolE1NgJS7oNzMzGmA0KXdHqBi0-lz8FahM7HvtOISEmD9BB_0AtjlZlaIOwGcSOqUtq_a6bBBm4qt7Yx4YjFFraUwOJEpeI4b-hDPEjI5-a0w5bqpYULiIMQ\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\"></figure><p>Then, in the trench, place two water buckets to move the mobs toward the middle. Dig a 3-block deep hole in the middle of the trench, place a fence gate or signs to stop the water, and place a slab at the bottom.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/845GWiXl9Al-R0UeqZkCvzEO2RTD26AZTkH9PFBhhE32AWG7k9Sp09SozP96q6nc_vt4qwyFp65gH7PJQLc4loqzAEhtn3SSHTzG0K1anWg2RU9vZRH00XZfiLawzHUC7j_lk5rWaGYgmBg9vp0x-QV8q-hng7uXM1F9Aj1EuxqyIXslh8sTLHq890rfHA\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\"></figure><p>Now, remove the torches and your farm is fully operational! Simply stand at the bottom and kill anything that comes through. You can even place a hopper underneath the slab if you want to collect your drops!</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-header-card kg-width-full kg-size-small kg-style-dark\" style data-kg-background-image><h2 class=\"kg-header-card-header\" id=\"2-crop-farm\">2. Crop Farm</h2></div><p>Food is essential to survival in Minecraft. You need it to run, heal, and to survive. One of the best sources of food is baked potatoes. Not only are they amazing in real life (you cannot go wrong with a baked potato, sour cream and chives. Absolutely delicious), but they are an amazing food source in Minecraft. They give good food bars, good saturation, and are easy to grow and cook. You can embrace the true Irish spirit!<br></p><p>However, harvesting crops is annoying. You need to break everything and then plant everything again! What if you could take one of those chores away? I present to you: The Potatoer 9000! Well… it’s not really that impressive, but once you build it I can assure you that your Minecraft life will be much easier. <br></p><p>The first step is creating an 8x8 plot of farmland. Then, put water on two sides parallel to each other. It should look like this:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JJNdHYAP_dbaX9tkPfQrnZ6mO54NxjOsekHZYMg0bex66OChTjvIZw4-iRjB0DTsFvDlwzG9aFv7Lpzwln0YjmpfoTD89uuFvkLJiNvffY2fMSGVbjabs6oJbDXNCfWMBrGuVFFCRnxTMS81S1z6wsG4IWc7jZNvGprpMxXhJYQtcl1BfzHRwAiiBk90qA\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\"></figure><p>Next, add trapdoors over the water. This not only hides the water, and makes it look pretty but it also stops water and items from going over the side.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Rrj-8pKJlw7Dz03oEENo6VALu1pi30meeQCrnpoXEoNy4l0VvmwofLJuYMqoYEcwLR5VDwUSH_il3iIsdbcaWM8f-hgy8tZrEn2BWwmnwU9cH-FCfHyLwGjRnswcS10Erk3bwDzVpqBop24tJvkUo5ue9gILoedx78EOY95_h3tlFPxFnNZupb_xzUWEbQ\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\"></figure><p>Then, dig a small trench in front of the farmland and fill it with hoppers leading into a chest. Make sure the hoppers lead into each other and then into a chest, otherwise they will not collect the crops that are being harvested!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/tYbUmcWIWpodq7sVNIoeTT_1ULjasiLUZBi8xv51nv2KHaaplFTM4ho_HJzkjfV6xTgg_IfkTdt6IB2LrqS8Em-mlg5W4Wy3DdKcVgYEplrkhUioZtDsQveD925-uwIbsvTmVgLPx1eFPhGASzWD-aULxkFJVJlDMoC1OreoGsJvVb3J0LaOZxOqM49VxA\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\"></figure><p>After that, add dispensers on the opposite side facing the farmland. Hope you can find a lot of spiders to kill! Place a line of cobblestone behind the dispensers and put redstone dust on top of it. Add a button or a lever on one side, fill the dispensers with water buckets, and your crop farm is done!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_-yh12OBM9B68eJ209s0EifnJFjHK0TGDNH9VxRpPDYc8YYz5o3nonT-XPV9XD_cS9_wqQsaVANtiM8H3sR0Elpb25cnHTn1e5FZe3K130PotVYYs7CYsbqBvbbN-9YcJS_Ur3Em1NMjQF-OXvKrTZat_qrGp2Sy9EOY3y_k4VkrteTHzKhIzYgtcDFJzA\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\"></figure><p>Plant your crops and when they’re grown simply flick the lever or press the button to release the water. The crops will flow into the hoppers and into your chest, ready for you to pick up! Remove the water by flicking the lever again or pressing the button again and plant your crops to grow for the next harvest!</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-header-card kg-width-full kg-size-small kg-style-dark\" style data-kg-background-image><h2 class=\"kg-header-card-header\" id=\"1-super-smelter\">1. Super Smelter</h2></div><p>Yes yes, I know. A super smelter isn’t really a farm. However, it’s imperative in the early game. It allows you to smelt massive amounts of materials quickly without much work. If you want to build something large or for some reason need copious amounts of gold a super smelter is essential. <br></p><p>First, build a row of 6 hoppers going into a chest. This will take smelted items from the furnaces and keep them in one place.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/iR-FrSLX8zemG4j-0k0SLbkMBMcbCLOYucg9MV-V1jFdWtlchhF5KOjt4XIdi_0aDrckSIksHBsaH4jKeHxiz75ZtcGBU26YbEMk9d8eB9qbK9HtYZB-d5JK_UQZZwZb5ku1ZjjRmpk0BZUb2c6jONYf2o2lZL0f2cugJLjDtp4ygV1etuqhoVK73NDj7A\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\"></figure><p>After that, put furnaces on top of the hoppers with another row of hoppers on top of that leading into the furnaces. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ivoXbyLJIpnIUpIGkzcV2UJWUZM-NJC-faK3szs2Mc5l5pWgrPbxzAV8Rm-vnccgo7AlXMwlLjmTT5On4bkP4kE4GRuPgqq-QGu2NPpjxw0tihwiri85mAmEjOID28JFtFC1UtTNo2ycclEdci2VoM4XDyPQsK-TLSKv0VUWYyx9YxavJjYcSzUP1kQBcg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\"></figure><p>Next, you’re going to want to place some hoppers leading into the furnaces on the back side. This will allow fuel to automatically go into the furnaces.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/OgOOr0XLr1nCtx-drAv9p3QUoFijM-GxaN7zBSRplrs0K6fK6Ufu4yX60R_oebApFXpurDXuhfg0lPWdhPliPP6wZlvuDJreqq_rqss88uQLGsl-qUP2Eo24EF8IWiQHHSePlYY7QHUSbK_RHJ3LCE2iFU3B1-OxLtoKQt5UUWm5C7DDvaohcVTXqshJFw\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\"></figure><p>Now, place building blocks on the ends of the hopper lines in the position below. I’m using cobblestone here but any block such as wood or dirt is fine. This is for the minecart chests to top at and bounce off of. Then place rails and powered rails on top of them as shown in the picture. Place a redstone block between the rails on the far side.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/yxrh2elNutrIXMkLiR7w5eZK5gEkoOPSudiiJo1ZnHfEtBS4GpJpt1x_BCerX0pMRPCX1dd_7yeF_MLen-M3imdT1KK1iCmDGlSX-2_EFSf2bwMBdU-nbCyTTrVONvB0Ydm-L1U5f5LlOY4-QHjRTWS8dwBa4OUcmSQcXSpy4I0qLyf3k9WHJ43fsPuvHA\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\"></figure><p>Next, place a lever underneath the topmost building block on the near side. This will allow you to power those rails.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/W6rjxO95CQoyQQriAOmqoRnY5t9gzfDPjfr3JRHLTRBbuhIg00q6XDG6kLPfChdRAbyRjp_EzsfQebntWzIu3e5Ie8Cv89lWanL500EH0ZejCdCqa8DR4oReyt5H58PDoURpBHrDLnCUWtiw1TTPB8tv5J2N1nZnczxhE9c81cHfo2925c5ga8881wzMQQ\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\"></figure><p>Finally, place your minecart chests, hoppers, and chests on top of that and you are ready to begin smelting! Place the items you want to be smelted in the top chest, and fuel in the lower chest, and watch your fully smelted items go into the ground-level chest! Make sure to only flick the lever once all of your items are in the minecart chest!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dpYwpbK0THIRxcWTsDcWtYPJMbXziM13kZS-FZ0194midZFr4QnBqakNPNahCCnT6gLTWbY5sCTwrA5uiFn7hATvig-RE6HMrCKo7TwbkhW59a7j-zVq7F2V9DOJmOi5TDXRwX0m08m86NCJxX4uwqtdg6VzRslHEninye-KqP4x-upyuNkJ-ZxcHYfPzQ\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\"></figure><h2 id=\"other-useful-tidbits\">Other Useful Tidbits</h2><ol><li>Redstone is best found around -63 to 15</li><li>Late game, Enderman farms, Iron farms and Wither Skeleton Farms can be very useful.

      "html": "<p>In this blog post, we'll cover 5 different features that you can code in Skript that will make your server stand out.</p><h2 id=\"1-a-welcome-message\">1 | A <u>Welcome Message</u></h2><p>One way to make your server stand out to new and existing players is by creating a custom welcome message that gets sent to the player when they join the server.</p><pre><code>on join:\n\tif player has not joined before: # new unique player\n  \t\tset join message to \"Welcome %player% to the server!\"\n\tif player has joined before: # existing player\n    \t\tset join message to \"Welcome back %player% to the server!\"</code></pre><p>In the code above, it will send a <strong>different</strong> message depending on whether the player that joins is a <strong>new</strong> player, or an <strong>existing</strong> player.</p><h2 id=\"2-a-scoreboard\">2 | A <u>Scoreboard</u></h2><p>Another way to make your players stand out is by creating a custom scoreboard. This script will require an addon called <strong>skBee</strong> [<a href=\"https://github.com/ShaneBeee/SkBee/releases?ref=blog.minefort.com\">download</a>].</p><pre><code>on join:\n\tset title of player's scoreboard to \"My Server\"\n    \tset line 2 of player's scoreboard to \"Line: 2\"\n    \tset line 1 of player's scoreboard to \"Line: 1\"\n\n// Alternatively, use a function which will let you update the player's scoreboard when you need to.\n\nfunction scoreboard(p: player):\n\tset title of {_p}'s scoreboard to \"My Server\"\n    \tset line 2 of {_p}'s scoreboard to \"Line: 2\"\n    \tset line 1 of {_p}'s scoreboard to \"Line: 1\"\n\non join:\n\tscoreboard(player)</code></pre><p>In the code above, the first code snippet will set the player's scoreboard when the player joins and <strong>won't be updated</strong> again. We set the <strong>title</strong>, then the <strong>lines</strong> of the scoreboard. In the second snippet, we've put the code into a <strong>function</strong>, allowing you to call the <code>scoreboard(player)</code> function which will then <strong>update</strong> the scoreboard. This is useful when you add variables to lines which will need to be updated when the variable is updated.</p><h2 id=\"3-a-custom-tablist\">3 | A <u>Custom Tablist</u></h2><p>The tablist is the list that shows online players. You might not know this, but you can modify the <strong>header</strong> and <strong>footer</strong> text, and also modify the actual <strong>display</strong> of the players' names. </p><pre><code>on join:\n\tset player's tab list header to \"Tab Header\"\n    \tset player's tab list footer to \"Tab Footer\"\n        \n        set player's display name to \"&amp;c%player%\n        </code></pre><p>In the code above, the lines 2 &amp; 3 set the player's tab header and footer to different text. You can add multiple lines, colours, and add expressions such as <code>%player%</code> and other variables. The last line then changes the player's dispayname in tab to red, &amp;c. (<a href=\"https://htmlcolorcodes.com/minecraft-color-codes/?ref=blog.minefort.com\">list of colour codes</a>).</p><h2 id=\"4-custom-staffchat-command\">4 | Custom <u>Staffchat Command</u></h2><p>All servers need a way for staff to communicate privately with eachother, and unfortunately Minecraft doesn't have one built in - that's why creating a simple <strong>/staffchat</strong> command is so useful.</p><pre><code>command /staffchat &lt;text&gt;:\n\tpermission: staffchat.use\n    \ttrigger:\n        \tsend \"[STAFFCHAT] %player%: %arg-1%\" to all players where [input has permission \"staffchat.use\"]</code></pre><p>In the above code, we create a command that accepts one mandatory string argument, and where the player needs the permission <strong>staffchat.use</strong> to both use the command and see the messages sent. Although it may look complicated, the <code>send</code> line simply sends a message to all players on the server that have the required permission. In the text, it displays the player (the person who ran the command), and the text they input (arg-1).</p><h2 id=\"5-custom-broadcast-command\">5 | Custom <u>Broadcast Command</u></h2><p>Although super simple to create, a sure way of making your server stand out is by creating a broadcast command. </p><pre><code>command /broadcast &lt;text&gt;:\n\tpermission: op\n    \ttrigger:\n    \t\tbroadcast \"Server Alert! %arg-1%\"</code></pre><p>In the code above, we've created a custom <strong>/broadcast</strong> command that accepts one mandatory string argument. In the <code>permission:</code> option, we've also made it so only <strong>server operators</strong> can run the command. Then, it <strong>broadcasts</strong> \"Server Alert! My Text\". You should modify the broadcast message to make it look fancy by adding colours or other things.</p>",

      "html": "<p>In this blog post, we will discuss how to read syntax from the documentation, and how to debug your code.</p><h2 id=\"first-off-what-is-documentation\">First off, what is Documentation?</h2><p>As Skript is a widely used plugin, many different websites have been set up dedicated to providing all the different syntaxes Skript has. A personal favourite of mine are the <a href=\"https://skripthub.net/docs?ref=blog.minefort.com\">SkriptHub Docs</a>. Here, you can find all of vanilla Skript's syntaxes and tons more of Addon's syntaxes too.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-read-syntax\">How to Read Syntax.</h2><p>The syntax is a vital part of how you write your code. Syntax is basically the format your code must follow in order for it to work.</p><ul><li><code>[<strong>optional</strong>]</code> - Text in square brackets like this is <strong>optional</strong>, meaning it doesn't need to be present for the syntax to still be right.</li><li><code>(<strong>option one</strong> | <strong>option two</strong>)</code> - Text in normal brackets and split with a line like this is a <strong>choice</strong>, meaning you can pick which one to use, however you must pick only one.</li><li><code>%<strong>strings</strong>%</code> - Text wrapped in percentage signs is essentially just user input. There are a few different types, such as <code>%player%</code> or <code>%object%</code>, and the input must be of the required type (however, object can be any type).</li></ul><p><strong>Example</strong></p><p><code>[the] (amount|number|size) of %objects%</code></p><p>In this example, as the <code>the</code> is in square brackets, it is <strong>optional</strong>, and does not need to be there for the code to still work. Furthermore, <code>amount|number|size</code> is in normal brackets, meaning a <strong>choice</strong> has to be made. The code will work the same with any of these chosen (please note that only one can be added). The word <code>of</code> is not surrounded by anything, meaning it is <strong>mandatory</strong>, and must be there. <code>%objects%</code> is now asking for <strong>user input</strong>. In this case, it can be anything, ranging from <code>%all players%</code> to a list variable such as <code>{banned-players::*}</code>. As the syntax is plural, our input must also be a plural (e.g. more than one). </p><p>Based on this, the syntax can be written many ways and still function the same:</p><pre><code>the amount of all players\nnumber of all players\nthe size of all players</code></pre><h2 id=\"how-to-debug-your-code\">How to Debug your Code.</h2><p>Everyone makes mistakes, and learning how to properly debug your code will be essential in your journey of learning Skript. </p><p><strong>Step 1: Errors </strong>- If your code has any errors when you reload it, the first thing you must do is <strong>read the error</strong>. Reading the error will usually give you everything you need, as it gives you the line number and what actually errors.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Documentation</strong> - Once you have read your error and revisited the line of code that doesnt work, you should <strong>search up what you're trying to do</strong> on a documentation website, such as SkriptHub.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Question</strong> - If you can't figure out what the issue is, it's probably time to <strong>ask someone else</strong>. Free Skript support is offered everywhere, for example the <a href=\"https://discord.gg/NvjxhTHFpe?ref=blog.minefort.com\">Minefort discord</a> even has a dedicated #skript channel. There are also other discord servers such as skUnity that offers dedicated support. However, in order to get your query resolved, it's best you should form your question properly:</p><ul><li>Include the code your working with. </li><li>Include any errors that you recieve.</li><li>Short and clearly, describe what your code should do.</li><li>Be patient and wait until someone helps.</li></ul><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue\"><div class=\"kg-callout-text\"><strong>Something wrong with this article? </strong>Reach out to me, @Adxm#9504, and we'll get it fixed!</div></div>",

A personal favourite of mine are the SkriptHub Docs. Here, you can find all of vanilla Skript's syntaxes and tons more of Addon's syntaxes too.\n\n\nHow to Read Syntax.\n\nThe syntax is a vital part of how you write your cod",

      "html": "<p>In this blog post, we'll cover the basics of Skript.</p><h2 id=\"first-off-what-is-skript\">First off, <u>what is Skript</u>?</h2><p>In order for your server to be successful, <strong>Skript is a vital tool</strong> you should be utilising. Skript is a Minecraft plugin that allows you to <strong>modify different aspects of your server</strong>. You can 'code' plugins in plain English, without needing previous programming experience. Skript is an event-driven language, meaning code is run when certain events are triggered, such as <code>on player jump:</code> or <code>on player world change:</code>.</p><hr><h2 id=\"the-benefits\">The Benefits</h2><p>The main reason that Skript is so popular is that <strong>no programming knowledge</strong> <strong>is needed</strong>. Every line that you write will be in plain English, meaning it is simple to understand and learn.</p><p>Furthermore, Skript has a <strong>massive support network</strong>. Not only is there a dedicated #skript support channel on the <a href=\"https://discord.gg/NvjxhTHFpe?ref=blog.minefort.com\">Minefort discord</a>, there are dedicated websites, <a href=\"https://youtube.com/@LearnSkript?ref=blog.minefort.com\">YouTube channels</a> and Discord servers that have been created to offer free support. There is also extensive <strong>documentation</strong>, so that you can easily find the correct syntax for your code.</p><p>Lastly, Skript is <strong>quick to implement</strong>. All you need is the server that Minefort provides, the Skript plugin, and you're good to go. Just run <code>/sk reload (file)</code>, and your script will be updated on your server. Simple.</p><hr><h2 id=\"installing-skript-creating-scripts\">Installing Skript &amp; Creating Scripts</h2><p>You can download Skript from the official GitHub page <a href=\"https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases?ref=blog.minefort.com\">here</a>. Drag the jar file into your servers <strong>plugin</strong> directory via FTP. Once you have done this, you'll need to restart your server. Once this has been done, you can start creating scripts.</p><p>In order to create a script, you need to use FTP to navigate through <code>plugins &gt; Skript &gt; scripts</code>. Once you are here, create a new file ending with the suffix <strong>.sk</strong>, for example <code>myscript.sk</code>. Now you need to enter this file using a text editor of your choice, however I suggest using Visual Studio Code. </p><hr><h2 id=\"coding-your-script\">Coding your script</h2><p>In this blog post, we'll create a simple <strong>welcome message</strong> that is broadcasted to your server when a player joins. The first line will be the <strong>event</strong>. This is the line that will run whenever the event is triggered. In our case, the event is <code>on join:</code>. Then we go to the next line, and indent. </p><p><strong>Indentation</strong> is a very important part of Skript. Each time there is a colon, the next line down needs to be indented one more than the last. You can simply tab to indent, or use spaces, but within the file, the same indentation must be used throughout.</p><p>On our second line, once we have indented, we can use the <strong>broadcast</strong> effect. This does what it says it does, it broadcasts a message to the entire server once our event has been triggered (when a player joins). We can now add our text to the effect. Within the text, we can use an <strong>expression</strong>. In our case, we can use <code>%player%</code>, which will be replaced with whatever the players name is. There are tons of expressions, such as <code>%world%</code>, <code>%item%</code>, and much more. Please note, you only need to surround the expression in % when using it within a string. Our text will announce \"Welcome %player% to the server!\".</p><p>Once we have done all this, our simple two lines of code will look like this:</p><pre><code>on join:\n\tbroadcast \"Welcome %player% to the server!\"</code></pre><p>On your server, you will need to run the command <code>/sk reload (filename)</code>.</p><hr><h2 id=\"core-concepts\">Core Concepts</h2><p>In order for your knowledge of Skript to grow, you'll need to be familar with the core concepts.</p><p><strong>Events</strong> are called when certain actions happen, such as if a player jumps or takes damage, or even when the world does something independant of entity interaction.</p><p><strong>Conditionals</strong> are pieces of code that can check to see if a certain condition is met before the rest of the code is ran.</p><p><strong>Loops</strong> are used to repeat a section of code more than once. While loops run the code aslong as  a specificed condition is positive.</p><p><strong>Variables</strong> are the most important aspect of Skript. Variables allow you to store information, which allows us to retrieve the information at a later time. Variables can be overridden, meaning we can use an expression within a function, such as <code>%player's uuid%</code>, to link the variable to each player.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue\"><div class=\"kg-callout-text\"><strong>Something wrong with this article? </strong>Reach out to me, @Adxm#9504, and we'll get it fixed!</div></div>",
